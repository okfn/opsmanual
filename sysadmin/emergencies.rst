Is this an emergency?
=====================

In order to better serve our users, we prioritise our work, primarily on the
basis of information that you provide us when :doc:`submitting your requests for
help </getting-help>`. But this leads to a problem, which is that requestors
develop a tendency to slightly overstate the urgency of their request, in the
hope that it will be processed more quickly. Everyone does this, even us!

The end-state of this situation isn't pretty. Soon everything is "urgent" or "an
emergency," which has several problems:

-  real emergencies get missed
-  system administrators are constantly interrupt-driven, and are unable to
   effectively manage their workload
-  any work which is not "urgent" takes a disproportionately long time to be
   processed

So, we need a way to define what an emergency is. This is difficult to do for
the Open Knowledge Foundation given the varied nature of our work. As such,
we're going to provide two lists which help explain what is, and isn't, an
"emergency".


It might be an emergency if...
------------------------------

We distinguish between the following situations:

"code red"
    Situations which are currently preventing our users from using services
    which we are reasonably expected to provide them, or which are stopping our
    staff from conducting their business.

"code yellow"
    Any situation which, if not addressed, could lead to a "code red".

In general:

#. Any unscheduled outage or breakage of any public-facing system is an
   emergency.
#. Any unscheduled outage or breakage of any system that is critical for
   you to do your job is an emergency.

Here are a few emergencies:

- a public website hosted by us is unavailable, unresponsive, or broken
- a mailing list is unusable, or emails aren't reaching members
- you can't get to your work email
- hackers or spammers have taken control of one of our web properties
- a **project partner or funder** has unilaterally changed the circumstances
  surrounding a project such that our deadlines have changed **in a way that we
  have no control over**, and thus requests for changes to sysadmin-controlled
  systems need to be processed faster than usual [#f1]_


It's probably not an emergency if...
------------------------------------

We don't want to be seen as `BOFHs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell>`__, but the cardinal rule here is:

.. epigraph::

  Poor planning on your part does not automatically constitute an emergency on
  mine.

That means that you should not second-guess the system administrators' workload.
Please trust that we prioritise work such that everyone is happiest over the
long run.

Here are a few plausible situations in which flagging a request as "urgent" is
not usually acceptable:

- you or your project team failed to identify all the dependencies of launching
  your new project, and now it needs launching "urgently" with support from the
  sysadmin team [#f2]_
- you want something done, and used to be able to do it yourself, but now it's
  looked after by the sysadmin team
- it's Friday afternoon, and you just remembered something you promised someone
  by Monday that needs sysadmin intervention
- you are a senior staff member, so your request is more important and should be
  processed more quickly than others

-----

Ultimately, we want to provide the best possible service to our users, just as
you do. We will of course still be happy to bend the rules for you every once in
a while. **We are all human, and we're happy to help you with an "avoidable
emergency" every once in a while.** Just please try hard not to make a habit of
it: remember the story of the Boy Who Cried Wolf.

.. rubric:: Footnotes:

.. [#f1] Please note that the critical feature here is that there is no way you
         could reasonably have been expected to know the situation was going to
         change. A similar situation in which the change of deadline comes from
         within your project team is not comparable.
.. [#f2] It's worth reminding you that we're always happy to consult at an early
         stage on what things might need to happen with our involvement to make
         your project a success! Email sysadmin-team@okfn.org with your
         questions.
