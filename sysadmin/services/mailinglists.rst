How to add a new mailing list domain
====================================

-  **NOTE**: While its possible to create multiple domains in mailman,
   its upto the admin/users to ensure lists with duplicate names are not
   created.

-  The current default is @lists.okfn.org
-  To add more domains, append the domain name into ``ansible/inventory/host_vars/s116.okserver.org.yml``
   in the relevant parts of the file

How to Rename a List
====================

See mailman documentation :

  - `How to rename a list <http://How%20to%20Rename%20a%20List%20in%20http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/faq.html>`_
  - `How do I change the name of (rename) a list? <http://wiki.list.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4030617>`_

**NOTE**: Some files and dirs need to be readable and/or writeable by
user/group www-data, others by user/group "list".

How to remove an individual post
================================

We do not remove emails from Open Knowledge list archives as a matter of
course.  As the email has already been sent to the list, so to all subscribers,
it is already public.  Also constantly removing emails places a lot of extra
work on the team.

It is possible to remove the email from the list archives, however this breaks
all links in the list archive.  Sysadmins will remove messages only for serious
privacy reasons; the current policy is that all requests are rejected (unless
there is a court order or equivalent legal obligation, of course).

This is quite painful. See also: `How can I remove a post from the list archive or remove an entire archive? <http://wiki.list.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4030681>`_

Log into our mailman host (currently *s116.okserver.org*) and follow the below
steps::

    # What list do we want to edit?
    ML="sysadmin-coord"

    # Make a backup of the mbox file
    cp -a /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}.mbox/${ML}.mbox.`SAVE-date +%Y%m%d`

    # Make a working copy of the mbox file
    cp -a /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}.mbox/${ML}.mbox.work

    # Enter the mbox and remove the posting.
    #BEWARE: *REMOVING* the post will cause renumbering of the subsequent posts in the archive.
    #You might want to *EDIT* the post instead and remove its content. Not sure whether this can be done with mutt though.

    mutt -f /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}.mbox/${ML}.mbox.work
    # Remove the new headers mutt has left behind:
    # BEWARE 1: Maybe other statuses are also possible, e.g. "R". Make sure they are removed as well
    # BEWARE 2: This would also remove such lines from mail BODIES which would be wrong!

    egrep -v '^(Status: O|Content-Length: [0-9]*|Lines: [0-9]*)$' /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}.mbox/${ML}.mboxwork > /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}.mbox/${ML}.mbox

    # Check that we really only removed the one post:
    diff /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}.mbox/${ML}.mbox.{work}

    #Is all fine? The proceed:
    #Remove the working copy
    rm /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}.mbox/${ML}.mbox.work

    #move the old HTML archive:
    mv /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML}{,.SAVE-date +%Y%m%d}

    #re-create html archive:
    sudo -u www-data mkdir -m 775 /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/${ML} sudo -u list /usr/lib/mailman/bin/arch ${ML}

How to remove a user from a mailinglist via cli
===============================================

``remove_members -n -N [addr1...]``

How to add a user into a mailling list via cli
==============================================

``echo  'person@example.com' | add_members -r -wn listname``

How to export mailinglist users
===============================

To list users of a particular list, with full names - *'Full Name'*::

    list_members --fullnames listname

How to upgrade mailman
======================

Mailman does not like to be upgraded while it has messages in its
queues. Therefore you should follow this procedure:

-  Stop mailman.

-  If you want, make a backup of the queues::

    /var/lib/mailman/qfiles/{bad,shunt}/

-  Remove "bad" and "shunt" queued messages::

    sudo /usr/lib/mailman/cron/cull_bad_shunt

-  Check whether there are still queue files::

    sudo find /var/lib/mailman/qfiles/ -type f

If there are no more queued messages, you can upgrade mailman now.
Otherwise proceed:

-  Prevent the MTA (postfix in our case) from passing new postings to
   mailman, but make sure it still accepts mails \*from\* mailman. I am
   not sure whether stopping the postfix service would work, so instead i
   block port 25 temporarily::

    sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 25 -i ! lo -j REJECT

-  Start mailman and wait until the queues are empty::

    sudo watch 'find /var/lib/mailman/qfiles/ -type f | wc -l'

-  Stop mailman. Revert the above step that stopped postfix from passing
   messages to mailman, e.g. start postfix, or remove any block::

    sudo iptables -D INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 25 -i ! lo -j REJECT

Now it should be safe to upgrade mailman.

Mailman Troubleshooting
=======================

Important folders

- Mailman folder::

    /var/lib/mailman/

- Mailman private archives (all lists, mbox files)::

    /var/lib/mailman/archives/

- Mailman public archives (lists available via the web interface, html files)::

    /var/lib/mailman/archives/public

- Individual list config (stored in python pickle format)::

    /var/lib/mailman/lists/${list-name}/config.pck

Reading list config::

    /var/lib/mailman/bin/dumpdb /var/lib/mailman/lists/${list-name}/config.pck

Modifying a list config

- Create a config file with content like 'key=value' pairs, key and value pairs
  can be read from the .pck file.
- In the config given below, we're modifying the list footer to include an
  unsubscribe link.

::

    cat /root/mailman_list_config
     mlist.personalize=1  mlist.msg_footer='_______________________________________________\n%(real_name)s mailing list\n%(real_name)s@%(host_name)s\n%(web_page_url)slistinfo%(cgiext)s/%   (_internal_name)s\nUnsubscribe: %(web_page_url)soptions/%(_internal_name)s\n'
     mlist.digest_footer='_______________________________________________\n%(real_name)s mailing list\n%(real_name)s@%(host_name)s\n%(web_page_url)slistinfo%(cgiext)s/%(_internal_name)s\nUnsubscribe: %(web_page_url)soptionss/%(_internal_name)s\n'
      # Apply the config to the list
     /usr/sbin/config_list -i mailman_list_config ${list-name}

Cleaning the Postfix Queue on the Mailman Server
================================================

Occasionally, postfix on the mailman server will have a large queue because of
rejections. Usually, there might a spam user who was sent emails which were
rejected several times ending up in the queue.

When this happens, run the following command to get a list of users and the
number of emails in the queue for them::

    postqueue -p | grep '@' | grep -v bounces | sort | uniq -c

Get the most offending user from this list and delete them from the queue with
the `postfix_queue_del.pl` script::

    postfix_queue_del.pl spammer@example.com
