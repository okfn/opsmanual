done with the following steps.

   access.
#. From the home screen of Google Analytics, select the admin button
   near the top right of the screen. (if when you log in you do not land
   on the home screen, you should click the home button on the top left.
   These navigation instructions get quite confusing if starting from a
   different page).
#. You should now be on the Account Administration screen with a table
   listing of the accounts your login has access to. Within this table
   click on "OKFN 2".

   listing of the accounts your login has access to. Within this table
   click on "Create a new property". This should be at the bottom of the list.

   (e.g. http://opendevtoolkit.net). Change the Reporting Time Zone to

   column will be called "All Website Data". Click on "View Settings" and
   rename that to the property name.

   Management. At the bottom of the page, under "Add permissions for", grant
   the users of the project all permissions to this property.


Google Analytics (global tracking filter)
=========================================

Each site is allowed a unique Google Analytics tracking code as per the
above Google Analytics (single site). On top of this, a global OKF
tracking code (UA-33874954) is added to every page to log data aggregate
data across the entire blogfarm. No additional configuration is required
to include traffic for a new site in this aggregate account, however it
is possible to create a filter on this aggregate account to allow drill
down reports of traffic for each site that is tracked. Administrators of
the global tracking code may add this filter using the following steps.

#. Login to Google Analytics with a google account that has
   administrator access to the global profile
