Request Tracker
=====================

Request Tracker or RT as it is more commonly known is request tracking software.  Open Knowledge uses it to track requests for work from internal and external users of our IT systems.

RT can be found at http://rt.okfn.org.  Even if you don't have an account with RT you can email requests into RT and these will be logged as tickets which the relevant team can act upon.
