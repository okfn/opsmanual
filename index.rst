Welcome
=======

Welcome. This is the OKF Operations Manual, where you will find documentation
and advice on how the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) operates. While primarily
intended to be used by our staff, the content here may also be useful for those
affiliated with our Working and Local Groups, as well as our broader community.

If you need help from the sysadmin team, please read the :doc:`Getting Help
</getting-help>` documentation.

What is this?
=============

The web pages you're viewing are maintained as a Sphinx_ project on GitHub_.
Anyone with appropriate permissions on GitHub can edit the content, and there is
a short guide to getting started:

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org
.. _GitHub: https://github.com

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`search`
* :ref:`sitemap`

.. This stops Sphinx complaining about the fact that README isn't in any
   toctree.
